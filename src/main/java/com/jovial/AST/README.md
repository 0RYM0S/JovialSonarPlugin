This package contains lightweight placeholder classes representing the abstract syntax tree produced by the language server.

For the proof of concept the model only exposes functions and statements.  Each class includes TODO notes describing what information is missing.

Future work:
- Replace the simplistic model with the real AST once parsing via the LSP is implemented.
- Add expression nodes and proper type/source tracking.

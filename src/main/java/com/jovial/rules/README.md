Rules infrastructure for the Jovial plugin.

- `base` contains generic rule interfaces and utilities.
- `rulesets` holds example rule implementations that demonstrate how analysis
  could be performed without a real AST.

Missing pieces:
- More comprehensive rule implementations using the future AST model.
- Configuration mechanism for enabling/disabling rulesets.
